# 02---JS-and-CSS-Clock
This project is from the JavaScript30 tutorial series created by Wes Bos.

In this project I practised CSS variables and working with numbers and dates in JavaScript.

I was using DOM manipulation via query selectors to find out the seconds, minutes and the hour of the current time
to update the hands made for the clock with CSS. This would then move the clock's hands 1° degree around the clock until
it reached 360°.
